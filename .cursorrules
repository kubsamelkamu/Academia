```

### Component Patterns

#### 1. UI Components (shadcn/ui)
- Located in `src/components/ui/`
- Follow shadcn/ui conventions
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Consistent API design

#### 2. Layout Components
- Dashboard layout with sidebar and header
- Mobile-responsive design
- Role-based navigation
- Consistent spacing and theming

#### 3. Page Components
- Server components by default
- Client components only when needed (interactivity)
- Proper loading states and error handling
- SEO-friendly with metadata

### State Management

#### Zustand Stores
- Centralized state for UI interactions
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Minimal re-renders
- Easy testing

#### Server State (TanStack Query)
- API data fetching and caching
- Optimistic updates
- Background refetching
- Error handling and retries

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled
- **ESLint** rules enforced
- **Consistent naming** (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components)
- **Descriptive variable names** - prefer clarity over brevity
- **Single responsibility** principle for components and functions

### Component Guidelines
- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Prefer **server components** when possible
- **Client components** only for interactivity (forms, state, effects)
- **Proper TypeScript typing** for all props and state
- **Accessibility** considerations (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### API Design
- **RESTful conventions** with consistent URL patterns
- **HTTP status codes** properly used
- **Error handling** with meaningful messages
- **Request/response typing** with TypeScript interfaces
- **Pagination** for list endpoints

### Git Workflow
- **Feature branches** from main
- **Descriptive commit messages** following conventional commits
- **Pull requests** with clear descriptions
- **Code review** required before merge
- **CI/CD** checks must pass

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Subdomain Routing
- Each institution gets a subdomain (e.g., `university.academia.com`)
- Middleware extracts tenant ID from hostname
- Database isolation by tenant
- Shared codebase with tenant-specific data

### Tenant Context
- `x-tenant-id` header set by middleware
- All API calls include tenant context
- User roles scoped to tenant
- Data isolation enforced at database level

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Secure session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password policies and validation
- Account lockout protection

### Authorization
- Route-level protection
- Component-level permissions
- API endpoint authorization
- Data access filtering

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Utility function testing with Jest
- API route testing
- Custom hook testing

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing
- Database integration
- Authentication flow testing
- Multi-tenant isolation testing

### E2E Tests (Future)
- Critical user journey testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness testing

## Deployment & DevOps

### Environment Configuration
- `.env.local` for local development
- Environment-specific configs
- Secret management
- Database connection strings

### Build Process
- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint checking
- Bundle optimization
- Static asset handling

### Monitoring & Logging
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics
- Audit logging

## Common Patterns

### Form Handling
```typescript
'use client'

import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod'

export function MyForm() {
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
    defaultValues: { /* ... */ }
  })

  // Form implementation
}
```

### API Calls
```typescript
'use client'

import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query'

export function useProjects() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['projects'],
    queryFn: () => api.get('/projects')
  })
}
```

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props typing
}

export function Component({ prop }: ComponentProps) {
  // Component logic
  return (
    // JSX
  )
}
```
